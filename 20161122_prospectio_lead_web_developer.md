# Lead Web Developer - Prospect.io - Louvain-la-Neuve

Hi! I’m Jean-Baptiste, CTO at Prospect.io.

Our team is building a tool that helps sales people to find and contact their prospects. We are automating the painful part of their job. At the moment, there are 4 of us: Vincenzo has built most of the product from scratch, I’m in charge of making it scale, Julian is growing the business and Andy is taking care of our customers.

We are currently looking for a web developer to join us building the application in Ruby on Rails.

Prospect.io just over a year old and the business is going pretty well. We have more than 500 customers (in 50 countries) and we are already profitable. From a technological point of view, the project mixes classical Rails development with API interactions (Gmail, Zapier popular CRMs...). We also maintain a Chrome extension. We are also transitioning to a single page app written in Ember (in other words: a bunch of exciting new technologies and challenges).

## We can offer you

You will take part in a worldwide project aiming to change how sales people work. We deeply believe that sales processes can be dramatically improved. Today, sale reps waste too much time performing repetitive tasks. As member of our team, you will help small and medium businesses to find new customers by automating the repetitive parts of their sales process.

Your role will be to lead the development of the platform: frontend as well as backend. In the first instance, you will familiarise with our stack (Rails and Ember) and the tools and we use and APIs we consume. You will practice these tools on a daily basis by coding client-side and server-side. As the team grows, you will become our go-to technical expert. You will discuss software architecture, define coding best practices, review commits, propose new technologies that are able to tackle challenges we will face.

As an fledgling member of the dev team, you will have full access to all the codebase, servers, tools, … You will review my commits just as I’ll review yours (two brains are better than one). You will deploy your code on production servers from day one.
You will evolve in a startup environment (no suits required :) ) implying you will also perform other tasks alongside the job description hereunder. You will be part of a strong team who like to share ideas, chat and have fun together.

The job allows you to be productive. Even if our office will be available for you to work from every weekday, you can choose to work remotely 2-3 days per week.
We offer a competitive salary

Last but not least, you will join a team that loves beautiful and user friendly products. Prospect.io was founded by technical guys who have SaaS product development in their DNA. In everything we do, we do our best to deliver high quality user experience and robust software.
